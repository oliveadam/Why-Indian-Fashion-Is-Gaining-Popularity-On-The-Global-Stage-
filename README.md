# Why-Indian-Fashion-Is-Gaining-Popularity-On-The-Global-Stage-
Indian culture is known for its diversity. Various languages, traditions, religions and ethnicities contribute to the culture of India. This variety of cultures and traditions manifests themselves in the traditional clothing of India. From the elegant saree to glamourous lehengas to the simple salwar suit, ethnic Indian wear showcases the remarkable diversity of India. 

Each piece of Indian clothing has a vast history behind it. From state to state and community to community, you will find that the people's traditional clothing varies in many ways. This diversity of clothing cannot be found in the traditional dress of any other country. 

Indian ethnic outfits have begun to have a strong presence everywhere from big fat Indian weddings to international fashion arenas. The vibrant colours, intricate patterns and distinct design of every article of clothing are one of the prime reasons Indian fashion has been gaining popularity all over the world. Over the past few decades, we have been seeing people, not of Indian origin flaunting their exclusive Indian outfits, and we are all here for it!

So why did Indian fashion get popular globally? <br>

1. The influence of Bollywood throughout the world <br>
The Indian film industry is one of the significant factors in the popularity of ethnic Indian wear. India's latest ethnic fashion trends are becoming well-known on international design runways, during film festivals, and other special occasions. Surprisingly, Hollywood celebrities have been noticed donning these incredibly fashionable ethnic ensembles. Popular Bollywood divas like Deepika Padukone, Priyanka Chopra, Sonam Kapoor and Aishwariya Rai Bachchan are maintaining Indian ethnic wear on the global stage. Their elegance and charisma have profoundly impacted the minds of people from different countries. 

2. Fusion of Western and Traditional Fashion <br>
Indian fashion by itself is deeply culturally rooted, glamorous and elegant. However, throw in western fashion and you get all of this along with comfort and class. Modern designers have blended the two to create a plethora of contemporary fashion that is both casual and sophisticated. From bandanas to pashminas and tunics, Indian fashion has evolved and impacted western fashion to a great extent. 
The traditional lehenga has also undergone a transition. Traditionally the lehenga choli is a heavy dress embellished with stone, pearls and embroidery. The heavy lehenga is ditched for an airy and flowy one, and the choli is switched with a crop top for a more casual look. 

3. The versatility of Indian fashion <br>
Although people tend to assume that Indian traditional fashion is usually meant for celebratory occasions, it cannot be far from the truth. Indian clothing is highly versatile. Kurti is extremely versatile clothing that people of any age can wear on any occasion, be it a party or an outing with friends. If you work at a casual workplace, then you can probably wear it to work too! 
Apart from this, most Indian fashion like sarees and lehengas are also available in more casual fabrics like cotton and can be worn to a casual get-together or to an office event. 

4. The availability of Indian clothing online <br>
This is another primary reason for the increasing popularity and demand of Indian ethnic wear in the global market. With the boost in e-Commerce, many small, medium and large-scale Indian enterprises have started shipping their products outside India. Online shopping for Indian ethnic wear has thus become more accessible than ever. It has also become easier for Indian designers and craftspeople to reach out to the global fashion market and show off their products. 

5.	High-quality fashion at a reasonable price <br>
The initial downfall of ethnic fusion clothing was mainly due to poor quality garments at exorbitant rates. However, with the increase in awareness around sustainable and ethical fashion, modern designers have made amends by improving the quality, design and finishing of the garments. Also, the advent of e-Commerce sites has made the availability of Indian suits online in USA easy and at reasonable prices.

Indian ethnic wear is making waves in the international fashion arena and we are loving every moment of it.
